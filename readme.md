# Repoview

`Repoview` allows one to easily create a set of static HTML pages in a YUM repository, allowing simple browsing of available packages. It uses kid templating engine to create the pages and is therefore easily customizable.

This is improved version of Repoview used for [ESSENTIAL KAOS Repo](http://yum.kaos.io).
